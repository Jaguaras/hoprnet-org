    "paragraphA":"The HOPR protocol provides network-level and metadata privacy for every kind of data exchange. A mixnet protects the identity of both sender and recipe ent by routing data via multiple intermediate relay hops that mix traffic.",
    "paragraphB":"Payments are handled via probabilistic micropayments, our custom layer-2 scaling solution on top of the Ethereum blockchain.",
    "paragraphC":" Relay mix nodes are rewarded for their work in HOPR tokens. Our proof-of-relay mechanism protects everyone from dishonest behaviour.",
    "paragraphD":" HOPR thus provides economic incentives to run a global privacy network sustainably - and at scale - without compromising privacy."
