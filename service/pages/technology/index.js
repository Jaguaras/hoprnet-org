                Everything we do, we get trackedâ€“often without even knowing it.
                And this data is then used to influence us and our decisions. We
                believe that everyone should have the chance to make their own
                decisions in their lives, as freely and uninfluenced as
                possible. HOPR has set out to protect your privacy, data, and
                ultimately, your identity.

                The HOPR protocol provides network-level and metadata privacy
                for every kind of data exchange. A mixnet protects the identity
                of both sender and recipe ent by routing data via multiple
                intermediate relay hops that mix traffic.

                Relay mix nodes are rewarded for their work in HOPR tokens. Our
