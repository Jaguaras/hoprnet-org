            <p>
              The HOPR protocol provides network-level and metadata privacy for
              every kind of data exchange. A mixnet protects the identity of
              both sender and recipient by routing data via multiple
              intermediate relay hops that mix traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payments are handled via probabilistic micropayments, our custom
              layer-2 scaling solution on top of the Ethereum blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Relay mix nodes are rewarded for their work in HOPR tokens. Our
              proof-of-relay mechanism protects everyone from dishonest
              behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              HOPR thus provides economic incentives to run a global privacy
              network sustainably - and at scale - without compromising privacy.
