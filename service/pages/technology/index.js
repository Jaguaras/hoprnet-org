          <p>
            Everything we do, we get trackedâ€“often without even knowing it. And
            this data is then used to influence us and our decisions. We believe
            that everyone should have the chance to make their own decisions in
            their lives, as freely and uninfluenced as possible. HOPR has set
            out to protect your privacy, data, and ultimately, your identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The speed of innovation is increasing on a daily basis and so is the
            amount of data harvested about us. We have the dream that
            digitalization can improve our lives without costing us all of our
            privacy. We have the dream that everyone can own their personal data
            again.

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              The HOPR protocol provides network-level and metadata privacy for
              every kind of data exchange. A mixnet protects the identity of
              both sender and recipe ent by routing data via multiple
              intermediate relay hops that mix traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payments are handled via probabilistic micropayments, our custom
              layer-2 scaling solution on top of the Ethereum blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Relay mix nodes are rewarded for their work in HOPR tokens. Our
              proof-of-relay mechanism protects everyone from dishonest
              behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              HOPR thus provides economic incentives to run a global privacy
              network sustainably - and at scale - without compromising privacy.
